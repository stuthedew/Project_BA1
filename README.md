# Congratulations Brett and Audrey for figuring it out!

I'm really glad it worked! It worked fine when I was testing it but I was just a little worried since it's been going for a few months.

## Changing the Secret Location

To change where the geocache opens, look on lines 13-15 of [cache.cpp](../master/cache.cpp). You can place the latitude and longitude of where you want it to open there. I used Google maps. Place a pin where you want it to open, and Google will give you the coordinates for it. You should be able to plug those directly into the secret location of [cache.cpp](../master/cache.cpp).
